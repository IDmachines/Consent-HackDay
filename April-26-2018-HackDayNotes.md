# Consent Hack Day at Media Lab

## Event site: https://mitmedialab.github.io/Consent-HackDay/

## #ConsentHackDay

## Functional Aspects

0. Provide individuals an easy to use method for expressing they do not consent to add tracking in a way that services must comply with

1. What is the policy? (Content)

2. How is the policy rendered for user independently of whoever created it? (format, language, display)

3. How is the policy coded? (Which bits mean what?) 

## GDPR Connection
* In context of GDPR consent, use of this cookie approach should be structured to become part of the consent process and the result should include agreement on the user terms with the vendor terms

* The Nightmare letter: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/nightmare-letter-subject-access-request-under-gdpr-karbaliotis/


## Other considerations

- Substitutability
    - Where you inherit policies from
    - Where you get the rendering

... carrots for the ad industry
- Intent casting
- Better signaling
- Better programmatic framework
- Eliminate fraud and malware
- Speed up load time
- Increasing operational efficiencies in a world where consent is in play
- Risk reduction, efficient audit reporting
- IAB Europe clearly states in their documents that the 'cookie' solution is a temporary measure. We can help them with design inputs that are more person-friendly.

## Technical Aspects
* There is a cookie capability that could be a good fit.  There are a handful of flags that can be set.

# End of Day Report Outs

# Business (Go-to-Market)
## Ideas
* Getting Mozilla, et. al. to add this to the browser
* Getting EFF to put this in Privacy Badger
* Getting friendly startups
* Q: What differentiates the different CMPs? 
* Two approaches: 1. Customer Commons listed as CMP 2. Customer Commons hijacks CMP's UI

## Buildable description (scope)
* Make an engineerable spec, something buildable, that we can evaluate against the intention
**DRAFT Indications for Use:** 
* "Provide data subjects a method for expressing they do not consent to profiling in a manner acceptable to data controllers."
    - Tracking is: ad tracking, profiling by third parties, 
    - Data subjects are defined by the GDPR
    - Manner acceptable is a cookie or equivalent

## Narrative to Technical Engineering Teams

## Narrative to Users (Tech Wizards and Muggles)

## Go to Market
### Possible promotional partners
* Linux Journal
* (See others above)
### Use customer commons as a certification provider
* Very heavy, slow process - lots of work
* 


## Benefits
### Data Subjects
* Peace of mind
* Removal of consent wall
* Faster load time
### Data Controllers (= IAB E publisher)
* Reduced operating cost / risk
* Align values with data subjects (= less friction e.g. on-boarding)
* Reduced incentives for ad-blocking
### Data Processor
* Reduced operating cost / risk
### IAB E
#### Publisher (website owner)
* Faster load time
* IAB PDF about why Publishers should use their framework - includes benefits and value to publishers. http://advertisingconsent.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/TCF-Publisher-Facstsheet-2504.pdf
#### Vendor (owns ad inventory / ad tech / data broker)
#### Consent Manager Provider (CMP)
### Civil Society / GDPR DPA

Basic Chrome Extension demonstrating cookie setting mechanism: https://github.com/TelegramSam/ConsentCookieManager






# Legal (Terms and Rules)

### Questions:
* To what degree does a blanket "do not track me" cookie satisfy the GDPR requirements for specific consent?
* Does a chrome extension give the data subject sufficient clear info?
* What are the requirements of GDPR's certification idea and how could we satisfy them? Could this act as an additional incentive?
* What are the transparent icons GDPR speaks about, who defines them (UI task)?
*
